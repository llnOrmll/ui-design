# Canvas Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial describes how to use the `<canvas>` element to draw 2D graphics, starting with the basics. The examples provided should give you some clear ideas about what you can do with canvas, and will provide code snippets that may get you started in building your own content.

## What is Canvas?

`<canvas>` is an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element which can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript)). This can, for instance, be used to:

- Draw graphs
- Combine photos
- Create simple animations

## History

First introduced in WebKit by Apple for the macOS Dashboard, `<canvas>` has since been implemented in browsers. Today, all major browsers support it.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

Using the `<canvas>` element is not very difficult, but you do need a basic understanding of:
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

### Browser Support

The `<canvas>` element is not supported in some older browsers, but is supported in recent versions of all major browsers.

### Canvas Specifications

- **Default size**: 300 pixels × 150 pixels (width × height)
- **Custom sizes**: Can be defined using the HTML `height` and `width` properties
- **Drawing mechanism**: Uses a JavaScript context object, which creates graphics on the fly

1. **Basic usage**
2. **Drawing shapes**
3. **Applying styles and colors**
4. **Drawing text**
